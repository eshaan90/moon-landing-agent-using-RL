**Reinforcement Learning for building a Moon Lander Agent** 

This project has two parts: first, developing a moon landing simulator environment and thereafter training a reinforcement learning agent to land on moon. 

The algorithm used to train the agent was expected SARSA algorithm and neural networks for function approximation.
